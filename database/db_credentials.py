# You will find details about your CS340 database credentials on Canvas.

# the following will be used by the webapp.py to interact with the database
# You can also use environment variables

# For Local Devlelopment

db = 'cs340_arringtd'


# For OSU Flip Servers

# host = 'classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu'      # MUST BE THIS
